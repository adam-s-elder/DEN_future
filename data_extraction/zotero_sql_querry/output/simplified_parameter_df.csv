Although the main function of the CBOs was to handle contact tracing, CBOs assisted with case investigation under some circumstances. CDPH also provided $14 million in funding to 19 Chicago-based federally qualified health centers, 8 hospitals, and 9 primary care clinics to implement CI/CT services for their patient populations. In addition to case investigations, these HCF-based CI/CT teams monitored symptoms, notified contacts, and either provided internal resource coordination services (eg, housing placement, medication assistance, mental health services) or referred people to the Resource Coordination Hub."
