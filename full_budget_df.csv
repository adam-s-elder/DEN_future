Project Summary:
Provided and created an information system solution that integrates multi-agency approval procedures, streamlines traveler registration, validates immigration and COVID vaccination status, schedules, and tracks COVID testing, and monitors quarantine requirements. When American Samoa (AS) intended to repatriate its citizens on a controlled basis in September 2021, this system was created to provide a holistic solution to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the Territory. The approach includes mandating incoming passengers to go through various cycles of pre-travel testing, 100% vaccination compliance or prioritizing fully vaccinated persons as travelers and requiring a quarantine procedure. To register, monitor, and manage all this information, the need for an Enterprise IT solution was critical for processing, reporting, and tracking any potential COVID-19 crisis in AS, especially as aggressive variants continue to surface in the areas where passengers are currently residing or staging while bridging IT data communications between the essential AS government departments and Executive Branch to provide real-time data needed for crisis management.

(As of September 30, 2022)

The TalofaPass (Safe Travels) program was designed to create a single platform for a multi-departmental effort to track, screen and collect travelers’ vaccination and testing information.  And, in the event that a traveler tested positive for COVID-19 virus, the ability for contact tracing and traveler information was readily available for public health officials to conduct their work.
The TalofaPass mirrored the State of Hawaii (Safe Travels) website to assist travelers and government departments to track all travelers and coordinate the relevant medical history as it relates to the CoVID-19 pandemic protocols.
The TalofaPass website continues to be refined after each flight to address any system or technical issues or improvements based on the travelers and government feedback.

With the Coronavirus pandemic gaining momentum in the United States and internationally. American Samoa was given cause to prepare a comprehensive Action Plan aimed to combat the entry, spread, and treatment of the Coronavirus in the territory. Towards actions to prevent and preempt the entry of the virus into the territory, TALOFAPass became the primary source of data collection, analysis, and interpretation to monitor any significant outbreaks of viruses or diseases by all travelers entering American Samoa used by multiple agencies on one platform.
The TALOFAPass Application is the first cloud-based solution created by the American Samoa Government (ASG) and designed to usher the territory into the 21st century. It has met its objective of being the territory’s one-stop shop and first line of defense for screening/monitoring the potential spread of any known viruses or periodic outbreaks. The project is ready to continue to accomplish its long-term goal of improving ASG’s resilience and response to any crisis and helping modernize how ASG facilitates services online effectively and efficiently. This will further support the government-wide emphasis on e-government to promote social distancing and accessibility to vital services. Further improving the overall preparedness, resilience, and
integrity of government services while moving into the digital space.
TALOFAPass will be managed by the American Samoa Government Technology Office (ASGTO).",876000.0,51857.45,51857.45,,,,,,,,No,,,1 Imp General Public,,,,,2023-03-31,,,,,"-, 21st, ACCOMPLISHMENTS, AMERICAN, ARPA, ASG, ASGTO, Acquiring, Action, American, Application, Assist, CHALLENGES, COVID-19, Complete, Coronavirus, Customer, DATA, Data, Desk, Equipment, Finance, Government, Help, Jan., Location, Manager, March, OBJECTIVES, Office, Officer, PERFORMANCE, PROJECT, Personnel, Plan, Processor, Project, QUARTERLY, Representative, Required, SAFE, SAMOA, Samoa, Service, Set, States, Supervisor, TALOFAPass, TRAVELS, Technician, Technology, United, VOIP, able, accessibility, accomplish, accomplishments, actions, agencies, aid, aimed, analysis, area, assist, assistance, assisting, automation, based, best, building, buy, capacity, cause, century, challenges, cloud, collection, combat, comprehensive, continue, created, creating, crisis, current, customer, customers, daily, data, day, defense, designed, developed, development, digital, diseases, distancing, documentation, duties, e, ecosystem, emphasis, end, entering, entrance, entry, equipment, experienced, facilitates, financial, fulfill, function, future, gaining, given, global, goal, government, hired, immigration, implementation, implications, improve, improving, individuals, integrated, integrity, interest, interpretation, known, line, local, long, maintenance, manage, managed, management, managing, met, modernize, momentum, monitor, monitoring, moving, multiple, need, needed, network, new, objective, operations, outbreaks, overall, pandemic, periodic, personnel, phone, planned, plans, platform, policies, policy, potential, preempt, preparation, prepare, preparedness, prevent, primary, process, procurement, project, promote, provide, queries, ready, reflect, registration, resilience, response, responsible, review, routing, screening, services, shop, significant, similar, social, solution, source, space, spread, staff, status, stop, supplies, support, system, systems, tasks, technology, term, territory, transition, travel, traveler, travelers, traveling, treatment, users, usher, virus, viruses, vital, wide, ○, ●",no

Most recently, testing has become difficult for residents to obtain, so the city is acquiring quantities of at-home tests for distribution within the community and has established a regional drive-thru test site at the Fitchburg Airport in cooperation with the City of Leominster and Montachusett Public Health Network.

QUARTERLY PERFORMANCE ACCOMPLISHMENTS:

1.	SAFE TRAVELS AMERICAN SAMOA ARPA PROJECT has successfully hired staff and personnel to staff this project with the support needed to effectively manage the transition of TALOFAPass.

QUARTERLY PERFORMANCE CHALLENGES:

The ASGTO has experienced several challenges in initially building capacity.

1)	The digital ecosystem in American Samoa is still being developed as new technology is being integrated to improve government services.
2)	Acquiring equipment with the current routing process. TALOFAPass was not able to successfully buy its own phone & line due to implications within its operations.

Quarterly Performance Accomplishments
•	Quarantine changes made to reflect current need
•	Covid Policy Edits made to reflect current need
•	Contract Tracing module changes implemented
•	Please see additional performance accomplishments attached.  
Quarterly Challenges:
ASG consistent evolving policy changes and needs to be reflected in system in short time frames.
Project Summary:
Provided and created an information system solution that integrates multi-agency approval procedures, streamlines traveler registration, validates immigration and COVID vaccination status, schedules, and tracks COVID testing, and monitors quarantine requirements. When American Samoa (AS) intended to repatriate its citizens on a controlled basis in September 2021, this system was created to provide a holistic solution to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the Territory. The approach includes mandating incoming passengers to go through various cycles of pre-travel testing, 100% vaccination compliance or prioritizing fully vaccinated persons as travelers and requiring a quarantine procedure. To register, monitor, and manage all this information, the need for an Enterprise IT solution was critical for processing, reporting, and tracking any potential COVID-19 crisis in AS, especially as aggressive variants continue to surface in the areas where passengers are currently residing or staging while bridging IT data communications between the essential AS government departments and Executive Branch to provide real-time data needed for crisis management.

(As of September 30, 2022)

The TalofaPass (Safe Travels) program was designed to create a single platform for a multi-departmental effort to track, screen and collect travelers’ vaccination and testing information.  And, in the event that a traveler tested positive for COVID-19 virus, the ability for contact tracing and traveler information was readily available for public health officials to conduct their work.
The TalofaPass mirrored the State of Hawaii (Safe Travels) website to assist travelers and government departments to track all travelers and coordinate the relevant medical history as it relates to the CoVID-19 pandemic protocols.
The TalofaPass website continues to be refined after each flight to address any system or technical issues or improvements based on the travelers and government feedback.

The program is operated in collaboration with the Puerto Rico Department of Health, non-profit organizations and includes a multi-disciplinary team integrated by different professionals.  The program consists of three core elements: contact tracing, vaccinations and direct services to individuals and families affected by the coronavirus.  The Contact Tracing Project particularly is aimed at investigating and tracing COVID cases within the Municipality, and it includes an outreach and community education component.  Some of the main objectives entail: 
•	Increase public awareness on COVID-19 preventive measures, to reduce the virus transmission, through educational campaigns and educational and promotional activities.
•	Develop and coordinate collaborative agreements related to vaccination and service delivery to manage the identified needs of the population resulting from research and screening efforts.
•	Investigate cases from Bio Portal information and self-referred cases.
•	Follow up contacts and cases until isolation or quarantine is complete. 
•	Identify active outbreaks and report in a timely manner to the concerned areas so that they can be addressed and prevent the spread of the condition. 
The Center also serves as a liaison to access and refer to other municipal units. Services under this initiative will be provided by an epidemiologist, physician, case specialists, health monitor and health educator
The main services provided by the program include an investigation and case tracking system, educational intervention and psychological and nutrition services, support for families in isolation or quarantine, referrals for Tele-Medicine, referrals for COVID-19 testing and vaccination, health education, spiritual counseling, motivational services, and life coaching.

The Program mainly consists of three core elements: contact tracing, vaccinations and direct services to individuals and families affected by the coronavirus. This project particularly is aimed at investigating and tracing COVID cases within the Municipality and it includes an outreach and community education component.  Some of the main objectives entail: 
•	Increase public awareness on COVID-19 preventive measures, to reduce the virus transmission, through educational campaigns and educational and promotional activities.
•	Investigate cases within 24 hours from BioPortal information and self-referred cases.
•	Investigate contacts within a 48-hour period and document contacts on the BioPortal. 
•	Follow up contacts and cases until isolation or quarantine is completed. 
•	Identify active outbreaks and report in a timely manner to the concerned areas so that they can be addressed and prevent the spread of the virus. 
•	Divert services to manage the psychosocial needs of cases that request support services to contribute to their recovery process. 

The Program also coordinates other municipal services to the participants with the Municipal’s dependencies. The main services provided by the Program include an investigation and case tracking system, outreach activities in the communities, educational intervention, psychological and nutrition services, support for families in isolation or quarantine, referrals for Tele-Medicine, referrals for COVID-19 testing and vaccination, health education, thanatology services, motivational services, and life coaching.",1821076.53,1816056.53,1674100.24,,,,,,,,Yes,Public health data systems,8896.0,1 Imp General Public,18 Dis Imp HHs residing in the U.S. territories or receiving services,,,,2023-12-31,,,,,"-, Apoyo, BioPortal, COVID, COVID-19, Caguas, Contact, Divert, Follow, Identify, Increase, Investigate, Medicine, Municipal, Municipality, Positivo, Program, Project, Tele, Tracing, active, activities, addressed, affected, aimed, areas, awareness, campaigns, case, cases, coaching, collaboration, communities, community, completed, component, concerned, consists, contact, contacts, contribute, coordinates, core, coronavirus, dependencies, designed, different, direct, disciplinary, document, education, educational, elements, entail, essential, families, health, hour, hours, include, includes, individuals, information, integrated, intervention, investigating, investigation, isolation, life, main, manage, manner, measures, motivational, multi, municipal, needs, non, nutrition, objectives, operates, organizations, outbreaks, outreach, participants, period, prevent, preventive, process, professionals, profit, project, promotional, provided, psychological, psychosocial, public, quarantine, recovery, reduce, referrals, referred, report, request, respond, self, services, spread, support, system, team, testing, thanatology, timely, tracing, tracking, transmission, vaccination, vaccinations, virus, •",yes

With the Coronavirus pandemic gaining momentum in the United States and internationally. American Samoa was given cause to prepare a comprehensive Action Plan aimed to combat the entry, spread, and treatment of the Coronavirus in the territory. Towards actions to prevent and preempt the entry of the virus into the territory, TALOFAPass became the primary source of data collection, analysis, and interpretation to monitor any significant outbreaks of viruses or diseases by all travelers entering American Samoa used by multiple agencies on one platform.
The TALOFAPass Application is the first cloud-based solution created by the American Samoa Government (ASG) and designed to usher the territory into the 21st century. It has met its objective of being the territory’s one-stop shop and first line of defense for screening/monitoring the potential spread of any known viruses or periodic outbreaks. The project is ready to continue to accomplish its long-term goal of improving ASG’s resilience and response to any crisis and helping modernize how ASG facilitates services online effectively and efficiently. This will further support the government-wide emphasis on e-government to promote social distancing and accessibility to vital services. Further improving the overall preparedness, resilience, andintegrity of government services while moving into the digital space.
TALOFAPass will be managed by the American Samoa Government Technology Office (ASGTO).",876000.0,136948.13,136948.13,,,,,,,,No,,,1 Imp General Public,,,,,2023-12-31,,,,,"%, -, -TALOFAPass, 21st, ACCOMPLISHMENTS, AMERICAN, ANZ, ARPA, ASG, ASGTO, ASTCA, Accomplishments, Acquiring, Action, Agriculture, American, Application, Assessed, Assist, Building, CHALLENGES, COVID-19, CSR, Center, Challenges, Change, Commercial, Complete, Completed, Continued, Contract, Coronavirus, Customer, DATA, DLA, DPS, Data, DataHouse, Dec, Department, Desk, EC, Employees, Equipment, Exceed, FAIRHOLT, FALEULA, FIN, FIU, FUIMAONO, Fagatogo, Feb, Fetu, Fetui, Finance, Government, Governor, Governors, HR, Health, Help, HelpDesk, Hired, House, IT-2, Infrastructure, JEMIMA, Jan., January, July, Lack, Length, Location, Maintenance, Manager, March, Meetings, NADINE, NAFATALI, NTE)date, Negotiations, Nov, OBJECTIVES, Oct, October, Office, Officer, Old, PERFORMANCE, PRECIOUS, PROGRAMMATIC, PROJECT, Payroll, Personnel, Plan, Processor, Project, Proposed, Public, QUARTERLY, Quarterly, Representative, Required, SAFE, SAMOA, SHANIA, SILIVA, Safe, Safety, Samoa, Schedule, Service, Set, Space, Spaces, Staff, States, Status, SubTotal, Supervisor, System, TALOFAPass, TOTAL, TRAVELS, Tafuna, TalofaPass, Technical, Technician, Technology, Total, Training, Transition, Travels, United, Use, VOIP, Visited, Work, able, accessibility, accomplish, accomplishments, account, accounts, actions, administration, agencies, aid, aimed, analysis, andintegrity, area, assessed, assist, assistance, assisting, automation, based, best, budget, build, building, buy, capacity, cause, central, century, challenges, changes, changing, cloud, collection, combat, communication, completed, comprehensive, continue, coordination, costs, created, creating, crisis, current, customer, customers, daily, data, date, day, defense, designed, desks, developed, development, difficulties, digital, diseases, distancing, documentation, duties, e, ecosystem, emphasis, employment, end, entering, entrance, entry, equipment, error, evaluated, evaluating, experienced, facilitates, favorable, financial, followed, fulfill, function, funding, funds, future, gaining, given, global, goal, goals, government, held, help, helpdesk, hired, immigration, implementation, implications, improve, improving, individuals, integrated, interest, interpretation, known, line, local, long, looking, maintenance, manage, managed, management, managing, materials, meet, met, modernize, momentum, monitor, monitoring, months, movements, moving, multiple, necessary, need, needed, network, new, o, objective, objectives, obtaining, office, operate, operations, order, outbreaks, outcomes, overall, owned, pandemic, percent, perform, periodic, personnel, phase, phone, phones, plan, planned, planning, plans, platform, policies, policy, portal, potential, preempt, preparation, prepare, preparedness, prevent, primary, process, procurement, program, progress, project, promote, proposal, provide, queries, ready, reflect, registration, request, reshuffle, resilience, response, responsible, review, routing, scheduled, screening, services, serving, shop, significant, similar, site, social, solution, source, space, spaces, spacing, spent, spread, staff, status, stop, submitted, supplies, support, system, systems, targeted, tasks, team, technology, techs, tenants, term, territory, transition, transitional, travel, traveler, travelers, traveling, treatment, unexplained, use, users, usher, utilizing, vendor, virus, viruses, vital, wide, work, workstations, years, ■, ○, ●",no

QUARTERLY PERFORMANCE ACCOMPLISHMENTS:

1.	SAFE TRAVELS AMERICAN SAMOA ARPA PROJECT has successfully hired staff and personnel to staff this project with the support needed to effectively manage the transition of TALOFAPass.

QUARTERLY PERFORMANCE CHALLENGES:

The ASGTO has experienced several challenges in initially building capacity.

1)	The digital ecosystem in American Samoa is still being developed as new technology is being integrated to improve government services.
2)	Acquiring equipment with the current routing process. TALOFAPass was not able to successfully buy its own phone & line due to implications within its operations.

Quarterly Performance Accomplishments
•	Quarantine changes made to reflect current need
•	Covid Policy Edits made to reflect current need
•	Contract Tracing module changes implemented
•	Please see additional performance accomplishments attached.  
Quarterly Challenges:
ASG consistent evolving policy changes and needs to be reflected in system in short time frames.
Project Summary:
Provided and created an information system solution that integrates multi-agency approval procedures, streamlines traveler registration, validates immigration and COVID vaccination status, schedules, and tracks COVID testing, and monitors quarantine requirements. When American Samoa (AS) intended to repatriate its citizens on a controlled basis in September 2021, this system was created to provide a holistic solution to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the Territory. The approach includes mandating incoming passengers to go through various cycles of pre-travel testing, 100% vaccination compliance or prioritizing fully vaccinated persons as travelers and requiring a quarantine procedure. To register, monitor, and manage all this information, the need for an Enterprise IT solution was critical for processing, reporting, and tracking any potential COVID-19 crisis in AS, especially as aggressive variants continue to surface in the areas where passengers are currently residing or staging while bridging IT data communications between the essential AS government departments and Executive Branch to provide real-time data needed for crisis management.

(As of September 30, 2022)

The TalofaPass (Safe Travels) program was designed to create a single platform for a multi-departmental effort to track, screen and collect travelers’ vaccination and testing information.  And, in the event that a traveler tested positive for COVID-19 virus, the ability for contact tracing and traveler information was readily available for public health officials to conduct their work.
The TalofaPass mirrored the State of Hawaii (Safe Travels) website to assist travelers and government departments to track all travelers and coordinate the relevant medical history as it relates to the CoVID-19 pandemic protocols.
The TalofaPass website continues to be refined after each flight to address any system or technical issues or improvements based on the travelers and government feedback.

With the Coronavirus pandemic gaining momentum in the United States and internationally. American Samoa was given cause to prepare a comprehensive Action Plan aimed to combat the entry, spread, and treatment of the Coronavirus in the territory. Towards actions to prevent and preempt the entry of the virus into the territory, TALOFAPass became the primary source of data collection, analysis, and interpretation to monitor any significant outbreaks of viruses or diseases by all travelers entering American Samoa used by multiple agencies on one platform.
The TALOFAPass Application is the first cloud-based solution created by the American Samoa Government (ASG) and designed to usher the territory into the 21st century. It has met its objective of being the territory’s one-stop shop and first line of defense for screening/monitoring the potential spread of any known viruses or periodic outbreaks. The project is ready to continue to accomplish its long-term goal of improving ASG’s resilience and response to any crisis and helping modernize how ASG facilitates services online effectively and efficiently. This will further support the government-wide emphasis on e-government to promote social distancing and accessibility to vital services. Further improving the overall preparedness, resilience, andintegrity of government services while moving into the digital space.
TALOFAPass will be managed by the American Samoa Government Technology Office (ASGTO).",876000.0,116767.11,116767.11,,,,, , , ,No, ,,1 Imp General Public, , , ,,2023-09-30,,,,,"%, -, -TALOFAPass, 21st, ACCOMPLISHMENTS, AMERICAN, ARPA, ASG, ASGTO, Acquiring, Action, American, Application, Assist, CHALLENGES, COVID-19, CSR, Complete, Completed, Contract, Coronavirus, Customer, DATA, DLA, Data, Desk, EC, Employees, Equipment, FAIRHOLT, FALEULA, FIN, FIU, FUIMAONO, Finance, Government, Health, Help, IT-2, Infrastructure, JEMIMA, Jan., July, Length, Location, Manager, March, NADINE, NAFATALI, OBJECTIVES, October, Office, Officer, PERFORMANCE, PRECIOUS, PROGRAMMATIC, PROJECT, Payroll, Personnel, Plan, Processor, Project, Public, QUARTERLY, Representative, Required, SAFE, SAMOA, SHANIA, SILIVA, Safe, Safety, Samoa, Service, Set, Staff, States, SubTotal, Supervisor, TALOFAPass, TOTAL, TRAVELS, Technician, Technology, Total, Travels, United, VOIP, able, accessibility, accomplish, accomplishments, actions, agencies, aid, aimed, analysis, andintegrity, area, assist, assistance, assisting, automation, based, best, budget, build, building, buy, capacity, cause, century, challenges, cloud, collection, combat, comprehensive, continue, costs, created, creating, crisis, current, customer, customers, daily, data, date, day, defense, designed, developed, development, difficulties, digital, diseases, distancing, documentation, duties, e, ecosystem, emphasis, employment, end, entering, entrance, entry, equipment, experienced, facilitates, favorable, financial, followed, fulfill, function, funding, funds, future, gaining, given, global, goal, goals, government, hired, immigration, implementation, implications, improve, improving, individuals, integrated, interest, interpretation, known, line, local, long, maintenance, manage, managed, management, managing, materials, meet, met, modernize, momentum, monitor, monitoring, moving, multiple, necessary, need, needed, network, new, objective, objectives, obtaining, operate, operations, order, outbreaks, outcomes, overall, pandemic, percent, perform, periodic, personnel, phase, phone, planned, plans, platform, policies, policy, potential, preempt, preparation, prepare, preparedness, prevent, primary, process, procurement, program, project, promote, proposal, provide, queries, ready, reflect, registration, reshuffle, resilience, response, responsible, review, routing, screening, services, serving, shop, significant, similar, social, solution, source, space, spent, spread, staff, status, stop, submitted, supplies, support, system, systems, targeted, tasks, team, technology, term, territory, transition, transitional, travel, traveler, travelers, traveling, treatment, users, usher, virus, viruses, vital, wide, work, years, ○, ●",no

Project Summary:
Provided and created an information system solution that integrates multi-agency approval procedures, streamlines traveler registration, validates immigration and COVID vaccination status, schedules, and tracks COVID testing, and monitors quarantine requirements. When American Samoa (AS) intended to repatriate its citizens on a controlled basis in September 2021, this system was created to provide a holistic solution to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the Territory. The approach includes mandating incoming passengers to go through various cycles of pre-travel testing, 100% vaccination compliance or prioritizing fully vaccinated persons as travelers and requiring a quarantine procedure. To register, monitor, and manage all this information, the need for an Enterprise IT solution was critical for processing, reporting, and tracking any potential COVID-19 crisis in AS, especially as aggressive variants continue to surface in the areas where passengers are currently residing or staging while bridging IT data communications between the essential AS government departments and Executive Branch to provide real-time data needed for crisis management.

(As of September 30, 2022)

The TalofaPass (Safe Travels) program was designed to create a single platform for a multi-departmental effort to track, screen and collect travelers’ vaccination and testing information.  And, in the event that a traveler tested positive for COVID-19 virus, the ability for contact tracing and traveler information was readily available for public health officials to conduct their work.
The TalofaPass mirrored the State of Hawaii (Safe Travels) website to assist travelers and government departments to track all travelers and coordinate the relevant medical history as it relates to the CoVID-19 pandemic protocols.
The TalofaPass website continues to be refined after each flight to address any system or technical issues or improvements based on the travelers and government feedback.

Quarterly Performance Accomplishments

1. Continued resilience and use of the portal in preparation for future outbreaks and work with
DataHouse on transition of support and management of current TalofaPass Portal.
o DataHouse has not been able to provide training for the transition of support to
GOVIT. They have indicated that they will be offering training at an additional cost
for the development of local staff to manage and maintain the current portal.
DataHouse has also indicated that the original contract has been for a full outsourced
contract of IT services to include management and support. DataHouse has
submitted a proposal for renewal of these services for regular Maintainence and
Operations of the current portal site.
2. HelpDesk Office Space:
o Have had a number of meetings this past quarter with ASTCA requesting cost and
estimates on a lease agreement with ASTCA on the building. ASTCA CEO and
CFO has agreed to work with GOVIT to work out the lease agreement terms to
include renovations and updating of the building to assure use for HelpDesk Office
Space. Current status is still awaiting details and proposed lease agreement from
ASTCA on the use of this building.

We continue to work and coordinate with ASDOH and DataHouse on the revamped
SafeTravels portal to be used for the Traveler Declaration program. This has also been
discussed as part of the renewal proposal plan being proposed by DataHouse.

Quarterly Challenges:

1. Lack of communication with vendor DataHouse on project management and administration of
portal site for use of current portal system by Department of Health.
2. HR and Payroll system changing accounts for some personnel staff under this project ARPA
account due to Not To Exceed (NTE) date error and unexplained changes.
3. Negotiations with space tenants and planning of help desk office space due to changes in office
spacing and plans in coordination with Office of Governor’s office space movements.

As of April 29. 2024, project is moving forward.

Quarterly Performance Accomplishments
1.	Continued resilience and use of the portal in preparation for future outbreaks and work with DataHouse on transition of support and management of current TalofaPass Portal.
o	Have had 3 planning meetings this past quarter with DataHouse to begin training and transition of TalofaPass Portal over to Gov IT.

o	Proposed training targeted to begin in May 2024. Currently working on scheduling Gov IT staff
2.	HelpDesk Office Space:
o	Have evaluated and identified a potential help desk office space behind DPS office in Fagatogo.  The space was previously occupied by call center Klaod Solutions and is currently being managed by ASTCA.  Looking at potentially utilizing this space for Help Desk Operations and currently seeking pricing from ASTCA on the lease.

3.	Continued support and existing use of the portal via DOH use for Health Declarations at the airport.  We continue to monitor and support efforts on use of the applications to support the needs expressed by DOH to utilize the current system for the AS Health Declarations when traveling back into American Samoa.  Currently still working with DataHouse and ASDOH.
Quarterly Challenges:

1.	Lack of communication with vendor DataHouse on project management and administration of portal site for use of current portal system by Department of Health.
2.	HR and Payroll system changing accounts for some personnel staff under this project ARPA account due to Not To Exceed (NTE) date error and unexplained changes.

In the middle of the increasing Coronavirus pandemic in the United States and around the world, American Samoa developed a thorough Action Plan to prevent the virus from entering, spreading, and treating the territory. The TALOFAPass Application evolved as an essential endeavor, functioning as the major cloud-based solution for data collecting, analysis, and interpretation. By utilizing TALOFAPass on a unified platform, many organizations are able to properly monitor travelers for the entry of viruses or diseases. This innovative tool, customized by the government of American Samoa in collaboration with the support of DataHouse, has become the go-to solution for screening and tracking possible viral epidemics during the height of the pandemic.  This effort is consistent with the government's emphasis on e-government, which promotes social distancing, access to essential services, and overall preparation in the digital era.

Existing TalofaPass portal has been transitioned to be used by the AS Department of Health for passenger health declaration data.  Travelers returning or entering American Samoa are encouraged to use the portal for filling out their health declaration forms.   The transition of this was to allow the current system to be utilized and not dormant due to the decrease in COVID and the need to track COVID cases.  The plan is to be able to revert the health declaration system back to TALOFAPass and utilize it customizing towards any future pandemic or health emergency that may arise.  TALOFAPass will be supported and managed by the American Samoa Government Technology Office (ASGTO).

The Commonwealth ended contact tracing on November 30, 2021, and the city has had to pick up that work. Most recently, testing has become difficult for residents to obtain, so the city is acquiring quantities of at-home tests for distribution within the community and has established a regional drive-thru test site at the Fitchburg Airport in cooperation with the City of Leominster and Montachusett Public Health Network. 
This project will benefit the health of city residents in particular and of the greater area in general.

The program is operated in collaboration with the Puerto Rico Department of Health, non-profit organizations and includes a multi-disciplinary team integrated by different professionals.  The program consists of three core elements: contact tracing, vaccinations and direct services to individuals and families affected by the coronavirus.  The Contact Tracing Project particularly is aimed at investigating and tracing COVID cases within the Municipality, and it includes an outreach and community education component.  Some of the main objectives entail: 
•	Increase public awareness on COVID-19 preventive measures, to reduce the virus transmission, through educational campaigns and educational and promotional activities.
•	Develop and coordinate collaborative agreements related to vaccination and service delivery to manage the identified needs of the population resulting from research and screening efforts.
•	Investigate cases from Bio Portal information and self-referred cases.
•	Follow up contacts and cases until isolation or quarantine is complete. 
•	Identify active outbreaks and report in a timely manner to the concerned areas so that they can be addressed and prevent the spread of the condition. 
The Center also serves as a liaison to access and refer to other municipal units. Services under this initiative will be provided by an epidemiologist, physician, case specialists, health monitor and health educator
The main services provided by the program include an investigation and case tracking system, educational intervention and psychological and nutrition services, support for families in isolation or quarantine, referrals for Tele-Medicine, referrals for COVID-19 testing and vaccination, health education, spiritual counseling, motivational services, and life coaching.

The Program mainly consists of three core elements: contact tracing, vaccinations and direct services to individuals and families affected by the coronavirus. This project particularly is aimed at investigating and tracing COVID cases within the Municipality and it includes an outreach and community education component.  Some of the main objectives entail: 
•	Increase public awareness on COVID-19 preventive measures, to reduce the virus transmission, through educational campaigns and educational and promotional activities.
•	Investigate cases within 24 hours from BioPortal information and self-referred cases.
•	Investigate contacts within a 48-hour period and document contacts on the BioPortal. 
•	Follow up contacts and cases until isolation or quarantine is completed. 
•	Identify active outbreaks and report in a timely manner to the concerned areas so that they can be addressed and prevent the spread of the virus. 
•	Divert services to manage the psychosocial needs of cases that request support services to contribute to their recovery process. 

The Program also coordinates other municipal services to the participants with the Municipal’s dependencies. The main services provided by the Program include an investigation and case tracking system, outreach activities in the communities, educational intervention, psychological and nutrition services, support for families in isolation or quarantine, referrals for Tele-Medicine, referrals for COVID-19 testing and vaccination, health education, thanatology services, motivational services, and life coaching.",1821076.53,1821076.53,1645061.31,,,,,,,,Yes,Public health data systems,12500.0,1 Imp General Public,18 Dis Imp HHs residing in the U.S. territories or receiving services,,,,2023-06-30,,,,,"-, Apoyo, BioPortal, COVID, COVID-19, Caguas, Contact, Divert, Follow, Identify, Increase, Investigate, Medicine, Municipal, Municipality, Positivo, Program, Project, Tele, Tracing, active, activities, addressed, affected, aimed, areas, awareness, campaigns, case, cases, coaching, collaboration, communities, community, completed, component, concerned, consists, contact, contacts, contribute, coordinates, core, coronavirus, dependencies, designed, different, direct, disciplinary, document, education, educational, elements, entail, essential, families, health, hour, hours, include, includes, individuals, information, integrated, intervention, investigating, investigation, isolation, life, main, manage, manner, measures, motivational, multi, municipal, needs, non, nutrition, objectives, operates, organizations, outbreaks, outreach, participants, period, prevent, preventive, process, professionals, profit, project, promotional, provided, psychological, psychosocial, public, quarantine, recovery, reduce, referrals, referred, report, request, respond, self, services, spread, support, system, team, testing, thanatology, timely, tracing, tracking, transmission, vaccination, vaccinations, virus, •",yes

Project Summary:
Provided and created an information system solution that integrates multi-agency approval procedures, streamlines traveler registration, validates immigration and COVID vaccination status, schedules, and tracks COVID testing, and monitors quarantine requirements. When American Samoa (AS) intended to repatriate its citizens on a controlled basis in September 2021, this system was created to provide a holistic solution to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the Territory. The approach includes mandating incoming passengers to go through various cycles of pre-travel testing, 100% vaccination compliance or prioritizing fully vaccinated persons as travelers and requiring a quarantine procedure. To register, monitor, and manage all this information, the need for an Enterprise IT solution was critical for processing, reporting, and tracking any potential COVID-19 crisis in AS, especially as aggressive variants continue to surface in the areas where passengers are currently residing or staging while bridging IT data communications between the essential AS government departments and Executive Branch to provide real-time data needed for crisis management.

(As of September 30, 2022)

The TalofaPass (Safe Travels) program was designed to create a single platform for a multi-departmental effort to track, screen and collect travelers’ vaccination and testing information.  And, in the event that a traveler tested positive for COVID-19 virus, the ability for contact tracing and traveler information was readily available for public health officials to conduct their work.
The TalofaPass mirrored the State of Hawaii (Safe Travels) website to assist travelers and government departments to track all travelers and coordinate the relevant medical history as it relates to the CoVID-19 pandemic protocols.
The TalofaPass website continues to be refined after each flight to address any system or technical issues or improvements based on the travelers and government feedback.

With the Coronavirus pandemic gaining momentum in the United States and internationally. American Samoa was given cause to prepare a comprehensive Action Plan aimed to combat the entry, spread, and treatment of the Coronavirus in the territory. Towards actions to prevent and preempt the entry of the virus into the territory, TALOFAPass became the primary source of data collection, analysis, and interpretation to monitor any significant outbreaks of viruses or diseases by all travelers entering American Samoa used by multiple agencies on one platform.
The TALOFAPass Application is the first cloud-based solution created by the American Samoa Government (ASG) and designed to usher the territory into the 21st century. It has met its objective of being the territory’s one-stop shop and first line of defense for screening/monitoring the potential spread of any known viruses or periodic outbreaks. The project is ready to continue to accomplish its long-term goal of improving ASG’s resilience and response to any crisis and helping modernize how ASG facilitates services online effectively and efficiently. This will further support the government-wide emphasis on e-government to promote social distancing and accessibility to vital services. Further improving the overall preparedness, resilience, andintegrity of government services while moving into the digital space.

Project Summary:
Provided and created an information system solution that integrates multi-agency approval procedures, streamlines traveler registration, validates immigration and COVID vaccination status, schedules, and tracks COVID testing, and monitors quarantine requirements. When American Samoa (AS) intended to repatriate its citizens on a controlled basis in September 2021, this system was created to provide a holistic solution to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the Territory. The approach includes mandating incoming passengers to go through various cycles of pre-travel testing, 100% vaccination compliance or prioritizing fully vaccinated persons as travelers and requiring a quarantine procedure. To register, monitor, and manage all this information, the need for an Enterprise IT solution was critical for processing, reporting, and tracking any potential COVID-19 crisis in AS, especially as aggressive variants continue to surface in the areas where passengers are currently residing or staging while bridging IT data communications between the essential AS government departments and Executive Branch to provide real-time data needed for crisis management. 
Project Objectives
• Traveler web and mobile application revisions
• Screener application revisions
• Travel exemption processing
• Self-quarantine module
• Vaccine registry
• COVID-19 testing module
• Inter-departmental Data Communications Platform for Departments of Health, Medicaid,
Attorney General, and Executive Branch
• Multi-language applications
• Help desk
• Design / End-User (the traveler) Functionality
• Design/ Administrative Functionality
• Required System Modules
• Project Management Expectations
• Technical Requirements
• Development of Licensing Options 
(As of September 30, 2022)

The TalofaPass (Safe Travels) program was designed to create a single platform for a multi-departmental effort to track, screen and collect travelers’ vaccination and testing information.  And, in the event that a traveler tested positive for COVID-19 virus, the ability for contact tracing and traveler information was readily available for public health officials to conduct their work.
The TalofaPass mirrored the State of Hawaii (Safe Travels) website to assist travelers and government departments to track all travelers and coordinate the relevant medical history as it relates to the CoVID-19 pandemic protocols.
The TalofaPass website continues to be refined after each flight to address any system or technical issues or improvements based on the travelers and government feedback.

1.	Continued resilience and use of the portal in preparation for future outbreaks and work with DataHouse on transition of support and management of current TalofaPass Portal.
o	Have had 3 planning meetings this past quarter with DataHouse to begin training and transition of TalofaPass Portal over to Gov IT.  Training and transition sessions have been laid out and currently working on schedule to complete this prior to the end of current contract with DataHouse.  Training sessions described below: 
 
o	Proposed training targeted to begin in May 2024. Currently working on scheduling Gov IT staff
2.	HelpDesk Office Space:
o	Have evaluated and identified a potential help desk office space behind DPS office in Fagatogo.  The space was previously occupied by call center Klaod Solutions and is currently being managed by ASTCA.  Looking at potentially utilizing this space for Help Desk Operations and currently seeking pricing from ASTCA on the lease.

3.	Continued support and existing use of the portal via DOH use for Health Declarations at the airport.  We continue to monitor and support efforts on use of the applications to support the needs expressed by DOH to utilize the current system for the AS Health Declarations when traveling back into American Samoa.  Currently still working with DataHouse and ASDOH.
Quarterly Challenges:

1.	Lack of communication with vendor DataHouse on project management and administration of portal site for use of current portal system by Department of Health.
2.	HR and Payroll system changing accounts for some personnel staff under this project ARPA account due to Not To Exceed (NTE) date error and unexplained changes.
3.	Negotiations with space tenants and planning of help desk office space due to changes in office spacing and plans in coordination with Office of Governor’s office space movements.  

In the middle of the increasing Coronavirus pandemic in the United States and around the world, American Samoa developed a thorough Action Plan to prevent the virus from entering, spreading, and treating the territory. The TALOFAPass Application evolved as an essential endeavor, functioning as the major cloud-based solution for data collecting, analysis, and interpretation. By utilizing TALOFAPass on a unified platform, many organizations are able to properly monitor travelers for the entry of viruses or diseases. This innovative tool, customized by the government of American Samoa in collaboration with the support of DataHouse, has become the go-to solution for screening and tracking possible viral epidemics during the height of the pandemic.  This effort is consistent with the government's emphasis on e-government, which promotes social distancing, access to essential services, and overall preparation in the digital era.

Existing TalofaPass portal has been transitioned to be used by the AS Department of Health for passenger health declaration data.  Travelers returning or entering American Samoa are encouraged to use the portal for filling out their health declaration forms.   The transition of this was to allow the current system to be utilized and not dormant due to the decrease in COVID and the need to track COVID cases.  The plan is to be able to revert the health declaration system back to TALOFAPass and utilize it customizing towards any future pandemic or health emergency that may arise.  TALOFAPass will be supported and managed by the American Samoa Government Technology Office (ASGTO).

ASG consistent evolving policy changes and needs to be reflected in system in short time frames.
Project Summary:
Provided and created an information system solution that integrates multi-agency approval procedures, streamlines traveler registration, validates immigration and COVID vaccination status, schedules, and tracks COVID testing, and monitors quarantine requirements. When American Samoa (AS) intended to repatriate its citizens on a controlled basis in September 2021, this system was created to provide a holistic solution to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the Territory. The approach includes mandating incoming passengers to go through various cycles of pre-travel testing, 100% vaccination compliance or prioritizing fully vaccinated persons as travelers and requiring a quarantine procedure. To register, monitor, and manage all this information, the need for an Enterprise IT solution was critical for processing, reporting, and tracking any potential COVID-19 crisis in AS, especially as aggressive variants continue to surface in the areas where passengers are currently residing or staging while bridging IT data communications between the essential AS government departments and Executive Branch to provide real-time data needed for crisis management. 
Project Objectives

• Technical Requirements
• Development of Licensing Options 
(As of September 30, 2022)

The TalofaPass (Safe Travels) program was designed to create a single platform for a multi-departmental effort to track, screen and collect travelers’ vaccination and testing information.  And, in the event that a traveler tested positive for COVID-19 virus, the ability for contact tracing and traveler information was readily available for public health officials to conduct their work.
The TalofaPass mirrored the State of Hawaii (Safe Travels) website to assist travelers and government departments to track all travelers and coordinate the relevant medical history as it relates to the CoVID-19 pandemic protocols.
The TalofaPass website continues to be refined after each flight to address any system or technical issues or improvements based on the travelers and government feedback.

With the Coronavirus pandemic gaining momentum in the United States and internationally. American Samoa was given cause to prepare a comprehensive Action Plan aimed to combat the entry, spread, and treatment of the Coronavirus in the territory. Towards actions to prevent and preempt the entry of the virus into the territory, TALOFAPass became the primary source of data collection, analysis, and interpretation to monitor any significant outbreaks of viruses or diseases by all travelers entering American Samoa used by multiple agencies on one platform.
The TALOFAPass Application is the first cloud-based solution created by the American Samoa Government (ASG) and designed to usher the territory into the 21st century. It has met its objective of being the territory’s one-stop shop and first line of defense for screening/monitoring the potential spread of any known viruses or periodic outbreaks. The project is ready to continue to accomplish its long-term goal of improving ASG’s resilience and response to any crisis and helping modernize how ASG facilitates services online effectively and efficiently. This will further support the government-wide emphasis on e-government to promote social distancing and accessibility to vital services. Further improving the overall preparedness, resilience, and
integrity of government services while moving into the digital space.
TALOFAPass will be managed by the American Samoa Government Technology Office (ASGTO).",876000.0,25359.71,25359.71,,,,,,,,No,,,1 Imp General Public,,,,,2022-12-31,,,,,"-, 21st, ACCOMPLISHMENTS, AMERICAN, ARPA, ASG, ASGTO, Acquiring, Action, American, Application, Assist, CHALLENGES, COVID-19, Complete, Coronavirus, Customer, DATA, Data, Desk, Equipment, Finance, Government, Help, Jan., Location, Manager, OBJECTIVES, Office, Officer, PERFORMANCE, PROJECT, Personnel, Plan, Processor, Project, QUARTERLY, Representative, Required, SAFE, SAMOA, Samoa, Service, Set, States, Supervisor, TALOFAPass, TRAVELS, Technician, Technology, United, VOIP, able, accessibility, accomplish, accomplishments, actions, agencies, aid, aimed, analysis, area, assist, assistance, assisting, automation, based, best, building, buy, capacity, cause, century, challenges, cloud, collection, combat, comprehensive, continue, created, creating, crisis, current, customer, customers, daily, data, day, defense, designed, developed, development, digital, diseases, distancing, documentation, duties, e, ecosystem, emphasis, end, entering, entrance, entry, equipment, experienced, facilitates, financial, fulfill, function, future, gaining, given, global, goal, government, hired, immigration, implementation, implications, improve, improving, individuals, integrated, integrity, interest, interpretation, known, line, local, long, maintenance, manage, managed, management, managing, met, modernize, momentum, monitor, monitoring, moving, multiple, need, needed, network, new, objective, operations, outbreaks, overall, pandemic, periodic, personnel, phone, planned, plans, platform, policies, policy, potential, preempt, preparation, prepare, preparedness, prevent, primary, process, procurement, project, promote, provide, queries, ready, reflect, registration, resilience, response, responsible, review, routing, screening, services, shop, significant, similar, social, solution, source, space, spread, staff, status, stop, supplies, support, system, systems, tasks, technology, term, territory, transition, travel, traveler, travelers, traveling, treatment, users, usher, virus, viruses, vital, wide, ○, ●",no

Project Summary:
Provided and created an information system solution that integrates multi-agency approval procedures, streamlines traveler registration, validates immigration and COVID vaccination status, schedules, and tracks COVID testing, and monitors quarantine requirements. When American Samoa (AS) intended to repatriate its citizens on a controlled basis in September 2021, this system was created to provide a holistic solution to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the Territory. The approach includes mandating incoming passengers to go through various cycles of pre-travel testing, 100% vaccination compliance or prioritizing fully vaccinated persons as travelers and requiring a quarantine procedure. To register, monitor, and manage all this information, the need for an Enterprise IT solution was critical for processing, reporting, and tracking any potential COVID-19 crisis in AS, especially as aggressive variants continue to surface in the areas where passengers are currently residing or staging while bridging IT data communications between the essential AS government departments and Executive Branch to provide real-time data needed for crisis management.

(As of September 30, 2022)

The TalofaPass (Safe Travels) program was designed to create a single platform for a multi-departmental effort to track, screen and collect travelers’ vaccination and testing information.  And, in the event that a traveler tested positive for COVID-19 virus, the ability for contact tracing and traveler information was readily available for public health officials to conduct their work.
The TalofaPass mirrored the State of Hawaii (Safe Travels) website to assist travelers and government departments to track all travelers and coordinate the relevant medical history as it relates to the CoVID-19 pandemic protocols.
The TalofaPass website continues to be refined after each flight to address any system or technical issues or improvements based on the travelers and government feedback.

American Samoa was given cause to prepare a comprehensive Action Plan aimed to combat the entry, spread, and treatment of the Coronavirus in the territory. Towards actions to prevent and preempt the entry of the virus into the territory, TALOFAPass became the primary source of data collection, analysis, and interpretation to monitor any significant outbreaks of viruses or diseases by all travelers entering American Samoa used by multiple agencies on one platform.
The TALOFAPass Application is the first cloud-based solution created by the American Samoa Government (ASG) and designed to usher the territory into the 21st century. It has met its objective of being the territory’s one-stop shop and first line of defense for screening/monitoring the potential spread of any known viruses or periodic outbreaks. The project is ready to continue to accomplish its long-term goal of improving ASG’s resilience and response to any crisis and helping modernize how ASG facilitates services online effectively and efficiently. This will further support the government-wide emphasis on e-government to promote social distancing and accessibility to vital services. Further improving the overall preparedness, resilience, and
integrity of government services while moving into the digital space.
